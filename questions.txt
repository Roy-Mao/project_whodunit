1.  TODO
Diffefrent machines interpret int and other premitive data types diffrently. 
Some interpret it as 8 bits while others interpret  int as 32-bits. Including 
<stdint.h> will assure you get what you type.

2.  TODO
Integer type can have different bits depending on the compiler. It gives no guarantee that an 
integer is, say 8 or 16 bits. By specifying uint8_t and associate this with BYTE, we can make
sure that one Byte means an unsigned 8 bits variable.

3.  TODO
BYTE  -  1 byte; 
DWORD - 4 bytes;
LONG  - 4 bytes;
WORD  - 2 bytes;

4.  TODO
"BM" must be the first two bytes of a BMP file.

5.  TODO
bfSize is the file size while biSize is the header size.

6.  TODO
If biHeight is negative, then the image should be top-down.

7.  TODO
biBitCount;

8.  TODO
File may not exist; Programmer might have no access permission to the file etc;

9.  TODO
We always read 1 element of struct. That is why it should be 1.

10. TODO
if bi.biWidth is 3, then the padding will be the integer 3;

11. TODO
It moves to a specified file location;

12. TODO
SEEK_CUR (the whence argument) is an integer constant which is used to specify the offset provided 
in relation to the current file position;
